BashDude - a simple bodular IRC bot written in bash

This script is a work-in-progress bash scripting homework collection. It was
never meant for professional use in any way, more rather for playing-around
purposes.

It all started when I first got into bash scripting. I stumbled over a small
14 line long plain irc bot bash script over at inamidst.com and somehow got
myself hooked to the idea.

I remember back when taking my first steps extending the bot people where
having a hard time supporting me with my bash-related questions always stating
that bash just isn't the proper language for that kind of task. Well, in the
end I guess I agree with you, but the aim was never to write a good irc bot in,
the first place - it is just a self-assigned bash homework.

And just to proove that it IS possible, at the end, here is the result ;-P

THE IDEA:
- The idea is to have an input file for messages, which are to be sent to the
  network, tail-piped to a telnet client, which does all the socket handling
  for us. The output of that telnet client is piped into a while loop. Incoming
  messages are fetched with `read line` for further processing. This setup
  allows basic two-way communication with an irc server. Incoming message lines
  can be parsed and replies can be echoed into the input file.
- The big aim is to keep ressource requirements and execution time for the line
  parsing as low as possible.
- We take advantage of the allmighty super-cow powers the source command
  offers. The advantages lay in a modular design by directory and filenames like
  known from other languages and in the ability to use one big namespace for all
  variables.

CONFIGURATION:
- The bot's main configuration file is etc/main.conf you may want to adjust this
  before starting the bot for the first time.
- The user file is var/users
- The channel auto-join file is var/channels
