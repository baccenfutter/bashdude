BashDude - a simple bodular IRC bot written in bash
Version	 : 0.23
Date	 : 2010-04-22
Tag-name : proof-of-concept

I've done a complete redesign and basically started everything from scratch.

FEATURES:
- connect to a single irc network
- auto-join a list of channels
- join on invite
- user-registration
- ACL management (extendable)
- in-channel user interaction

I'll keep development in progress on this, so stay sticky!
